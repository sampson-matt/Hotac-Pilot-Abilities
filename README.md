# Hotac Upgrade Cards

Custom Upgrade Cards for the Heroes of the Aturi Cluster X-Wing Miniatures Campaign

Notes:
* These were all created using the custom upgrade card feature at Infinite Arenas
* Presently includes the Rebel Pilots that have been implemented in Sandrem's FlyCasual (as I'm creating these for use in my FlyCasual mod)
* As I continue to work on my FlyCasual mod, I'm also adding custom upgrades that are found on the HotAC elite pilot cards. Many of these are modified versions of X-Wing 1.0 upgrades
